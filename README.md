XR Starter Kit Is a playground for me to create new VR Interactions such as Alyx style distance grabbing, Alyx inspired Inventory system, VR Ready guns with firing mechanics and recoil, shooting mini-games, extra interactables (i.e. doors, sliding drawers, rotating knobs, levers) to help jump-start your VR game. This package also contains other useful and free XRI unity assets they have developed such as some of the levers.

XR Hand Poser is a simple hand posing solution asset built for the UnityXR Interaction Toolkit. This asset only relies on UnityXR and requires no third-party tools or assets. You can easily add or create hand poses and animations without having to rely on Animator controllers and keeping track of unity animations and string-based names. The Hand Posing system is built abstracted from UnityXR and can be modified to work with other interaction systems.

This is made with Unity 2022.2.6f1
